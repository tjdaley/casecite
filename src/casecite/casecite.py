For each of these Texas family law citations, verify if it directly supports or refutes:
"{user_proposition}"

Citations to verify:
{citations}

For each citation, please follow this exact process:

1. Recall the specific holding or statutory language
2. Rate your confidence in your recall (High/Medium/Low)
3. Explain exactly how it supports or refutes the proposition
4. Mark any citations you cannot verify with specific details as "UNABLE TO VERIFY"
5. For case law, note the factual context and how closely it matches our scenario

After verifying each citation, please follow these exact steps:
STEP 1: Final Verified List
Provide a final list containing ONLY citations you've verified with High or Medium confidence that directly support or refute the proposition.

For each verified citation include:
1. Full citation in proper Bluebook format
2. A 1-2 sentence direct quote or precise description of the relevant holding/provision
3. Brief explanation (2-3 sentences) of how this directly applies

STEP 2: Knowledge Limitations
Finally, note any limitations in your response, such as:
- Recent developments after your training data
- Potentially relevant authority you cannot confidently recall
- Areas where additional research would be beneficial
